# Java-school-projects

These two projects were done during high school using Java and JavaFX.

The first project is a calculator â€” a simple program with a graphical interface and basic functions.
The second project is a bank. It includes three types of deposit accounts, represented as jars, each with different interest rates. You can calculate how much you would earn by investing money into different jars for various periods of time.
